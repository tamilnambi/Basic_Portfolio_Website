        <h1>Personal Interests and Hobbies</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Apart from my professional pursuits, I am passionate about <i>traveling</i>
          and <i>photography</i>. I find inspiration in exploring new places and
          cultures, meeting people from different backgrounds, and capturing the
          beauty of the world through my camera lens.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a travel enthusiast, I have visited 9 states of India
          and 4 countries outside India, which have broadened my
          perspective and enriched my understanding of the world. I believe that
          traveling is not only a way to escape routine, but also a means to
          learn and grow as a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Photography is another hobby that I enjoy in my free time. I love
          capturing moments and emotions through my camera, whether it's a
          beautiful landscape, a candid portrait, or an abstract composition. I
          am self-taught and constantly learning new techniques and styles to
          improve my skills and express my creativity.
